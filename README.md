# Codewars

This repository contains solutions to few coding challenges from codewars.com. Whenever I was bored/frustrated by current
project/book/tutorial or just wanted to engage in some creative problem-solving, I tended to visit this website. Because 
my <a href=https://www.codewars.com/users/wroku/stats>profile</a> shows only some stats and list of successfully coded tasks
I added few solutions here. Descriptions of problems and links are stated before scripts.
